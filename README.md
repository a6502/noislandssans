# NoIslandsSans
NoIslandsSans is a OpenSans font clone without loose islands/insets - ideal for CNC cutters

On the main latin characters (and arabic numbers) the islands
have been "cut open". That is, bridges connect the former
outer and inner parts of the character elements.
When cut along its outlines, the characters should not have parts falling out.

The 88 units refer to the width of the bridges.
The glyph for "A" is 1468 units high, so the bridges are
roughly 6% the height of that character.

To edit the font, use [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/).
